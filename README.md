Clients can contact me if they need to plants.So from this website I allow some features to contact me by my phone number, email and my home address. 

About website sturcture I used html,css, javascript and php to create my website and connect it with the database over a server.

About database - I used wamp server to connect my database with my website. I created my database in wamp server in PhpMyAdmin.There is one table which is created for getting detail from the contact form. There are contact id, full name, email , phone number and adress.When you fill the contact from, the database will collect those details to the table.

This is localhost server, and it can t execute in online, need to install the server in your device and then with the localhost url you can visit website and check the database as well as. To do this task first please download the zip file from the github repository and save it in your device in server folder in your C folder.Then with localhost url visit the website and check the database as well as.
